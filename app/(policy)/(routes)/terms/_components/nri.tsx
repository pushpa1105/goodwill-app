        <p className="text-[#8E8E8E]  md:text-base text-sm mt-2">
          An NRI demat account comes with a set of rules and regulations simply
          for the reason that two different economies get involved.Further more,
          there are tax regulations and requirements that one needs to take care
          of.Most of the times, you are supposed to pay tax once and if the
          country your are residing in, has a larger tax slab percentagethan you
          might have been charged in India,you only need to pay the residual to
          the foreign government post paying the taxes in India.
